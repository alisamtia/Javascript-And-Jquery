<p ondblclick="al()">Here are the changes made:

Used parseFloat to parse the percentage input as a floating-point number. This ensures that you can compare it correctly.

Replaced elseif with else if for all the additional conditions.

Corrected the conditionals for checking the percentage ranges, using >= and <= for greater than or equal to and less than or equal to comparisons.

Corrected the condition for checking if the percentage is less than or equal to 33 and greater than or equal to 0.

With these changes, your code should work as intended.<p>
